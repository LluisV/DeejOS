This application offers a friendly interface to interact with the system through an ESP32-like microcontroller.

In my case the system has:
- 1 ESP32
- 5 normal potentiometers
- 5 slider potentiometers
- 3 Toggles
- 1 3.5'' TFT touch screen
- 1 DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor

You can install the application on your device through Arduino IDE. In case you get an error saying that the app is too large, go to Tools/Partition scheme and select a partition larger than the current one.
